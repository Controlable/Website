          Our Mission
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-8 text-center text-base">
          Making advanced industrial AI accessible — without cloud dependency
          <br />
          Our mission is to make advanced AI and machine learning accessible to
          every production company.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-8 text-center text-base">
          Too often, industrial intelligence is tied to expensive hardware,
          heavy cloud infrastructures and external platforms that create
          long-term dependency and limit control. We believe industrial
          organisations should retain ownership of their data, their models and
          their operational decisions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-8 text-center text-base">
          By using affordable edge technology and on-device intelligence, we
          enable organisations of any scale to improve efficiency, reduce energy
          costs, extend asset lifetime and improve product quality — while
          keeping full control over their data and systems.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-12 text-center text-base">
          In doing so, we accelerate both the digitalisation and the
          sustainability of the manufacturing industry.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-6 text-center text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-slate-900">
          How It Works
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-8 text-center text-base">
          From raw signals to actionable insight — at the edge
          <br />
          Edge sensor nodes capture machine behaviour directly at the source.
          TinyML models analyse this data locally and detect deviations and
          anomalies in real time, even in environments with limited
          connectivity.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-8 text-center text-base">
          Only relevant insights and health indicators are transmitted, keeping
          bandwidth usage, storage requirements and cloud dependency to a
          minimum. Dashboards provide clear, actionable views for operations and
          maintenance teams.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-12 text-center text-base">
          As data accumulates, models mature and enable predictive maintenance
          and digital-twin applications.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-6 text-center text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-slate-900">
          Why This Is Different
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-8 text-center text-base">
          Edge-first intelligence, designed for real-world industry
          <br />
          Most industrial AI solutions rely on expensive sensors, centralised
          cloud processing and long integration projects.
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-8 list-inside list-disc space-y-2 text-base">
          <li>Edge-first architecture</li>
          <li>Affordable, scalable hardware</li>
          <li>SaaS delivery without lock-in</li>
          <li>Full data ownership for the customer</li>
          <li>No specialised AI teams required</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-12 text-center text-base">
          This allows organisations to start small, validate quickly and scale
          with confidence — without committing to heavy infrastructure or
          external platforms.
        </p>
